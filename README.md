# Project

This project is developed as an example for the lecture Software Engineering at the HTWG Konstanz. 

You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

## Shithead

Shithead is a card game played up to 4 players. The goal is to get rid off all cards. So the player with no cards first wins.

You can place your stones by inputting a two-indexed location. All adjacent Fields with opposite stones become your own.
